# Data Bricks

lets understand this little bit, then we perform our Analytics.

Before going to databricks lets know a little bit about spark

# Apache Spark

spark is an open source unified analytics engine for large scale of data processing.

These are the features.

1) FAST and Efficient
2) In memory engine
3) Highly Scalable Architecture
4) Unifies Vareity of use cases

# Hadoop

Hadoop is an open-source distributed storage and processing framework. 

It is primarily used for storing and processing **large volumes of data across a cluster of commodity hardware**.

understand this line in hirarchy level, at last the data going to be stored at hardware.

It uses **HDFS** hadoop distributed file system.

A filesystem is a method of storing / finding files on a hard disk.

It uses **MAPREDUCE** programming model to process the data.

which is written on **Java**.

# DATABRICKS

Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform that is built on top of Apache Spark, which is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. 

**cluster** Have the spark engine and other compnents that make the computation successful.

 Databricks integrates with a wide range of data sources and services,
 
 including data lakes, databases, and third-party libraries.

 so by integrating with data lake we run our project.

 # lets mount the azure data lake to azure data bricks dbfs.
